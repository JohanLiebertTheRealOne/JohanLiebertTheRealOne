#Hi there! I'd love to work you.

## Who am I ?
As someone who is very passionate about self-improvement, I've found my One Thing—for life.
And that thing is coding.

## My passion
It's a lifelong journey of learning.
No detours, no off-ramps, just failing, learning, and back at it again.

## What I focus on:
Building websites, software, and applications, that provide the greatest value to the most people—humanly possible.

##Who I work with:
I'm open to working with anyone, but I especially resonate with people who are passionate, committed, motivated, or disciplined.

Reach out to me now—this won't be around forever.
